# Notes on votebox enclosure prototype

### June 30, 2016
* Lengthen the box along the y axis (front-back of printer). The printer barely fits into the enclosure with the top on in the current design.
* Serious issues with paper jams along the accept path. It is critical to ensure that no irregularities exist that might snag the paper while it is exiting the printer mechanism.
* Increase the vertical spacing between the bottom and top box parts, to at least 6 mm. Occasional issues with paper jamming on the reject path in the current configuration.

# Notes on replacing HP1000 with HP1010 body
* On the 3-wire connector that leads to the optointerrupter, the yellow and black wires are switched: yellow is now the LED anode, and black is the phototransistor collector. Green remains ground.
* Parts removed from printer (all reversible):
    * Front paper tray, secured with plastic tabs
    * Top panel, secured with screws and plastic tabs
    * Main circuit board, screws
    * Ribbon cable fasteners, plastic tabs
    * Optical encoder strip, metal hook
    * Print head shuttle, pull out
    * Shuttle belt tensioner, screw
    * Shuttle belt
