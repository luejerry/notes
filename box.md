# Notes on votebox enclosure prototype

### June 30, 2016
* Lengthen the box along the y axis (front-back of printer). The printer barely fits into the enclosure with the top on in the current design.
* Serious issues with paper jams along the accept path. It is critical to ensure that no irregularities exist that might snag the paper while it is exiting the printer mechanism.
* Increase the vertical spacing between the bottom and top box parts, to at least 6 mm. Occasional issues with paper jamming on the reject path in the current configuration.
